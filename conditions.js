// == means equal to
// 5 == 5 True
// 5 == 4 False

// != means not equal
// 5 != 6 it's true

// < > means greater than and less than
// 10 < 12 True
// 10 < 9 False
// 10 > 9 True
// 10 > 13 False

// Try to avoid using == but use === when we're using as a string

parameter with the variable so if(variable) is true then we open braquets
